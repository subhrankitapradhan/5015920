Q.1 Explain how arrays are represented in memory and their advantages.

Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory, where each element in the array is of the same type and size. 
This allows for constant-time access (O(1)) to any element in the array by using its index, as the index can be used to directly
calculate the memory address of the element.

Advantages of Arrays
Constant Time Access: The biggest advantage of arrays is that they provide O(1) time complexity for accessing elements.
Cache Friendly: Due to their contiguous memory allocation, arrays exhibit good locality of reference and are cache-friendly.
Simple Implementation: Arrays are straightforward to use and implement.
