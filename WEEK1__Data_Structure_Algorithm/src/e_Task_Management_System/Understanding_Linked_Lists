Q.1 Explain the different types of linked lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List).

Singly Linked List
A singly linked list is a collection of nodes where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list. 
The last node points to null. Operations like insertion and deletion are efficient as they only require updating the next reference.

Doubly Linked List
A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list but each node contains two references: one to the next node and one to the previous node.
This allows traversal in both directions. It requires more memory due to the additional previous reference but makes certain operations more efficient.
