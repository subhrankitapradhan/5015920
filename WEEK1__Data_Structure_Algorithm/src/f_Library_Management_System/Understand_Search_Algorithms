Q.1 Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.

Linear Search
Linear search is a straightforward algorithm that checks each element in the list sequentially until the target element is found or the list ends. 
It does not require the list to be sorted.

Binary Search
Binary search is a more efficient algorithm that requires the list to be sorted. 
It repeatedly divides the search interval in half, comparing the target value with the middle element.
If the target is equal to the middle element, the search is successful. If the target is less, the search continues in the lower half; 
if greater, in the upper half.
