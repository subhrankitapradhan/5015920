Q.1 Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.








Q.2 Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.

Best Case: The minimum time an algorithm can take to complete. For example, in a search operation, 
           the best case occurs when the desired element is the first element of the array.

Average Case: The expected time an algorithm takes to complete, averaged over all possible inputs.

Worst Case: The maximum time an algorithm can take to complete. For example, in a search operation, 
             the worst case occurs when the desired element is not present or is the last element of the array.
