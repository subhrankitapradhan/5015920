Q.1 Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.

ANS :

We use data Structures and algorithms for handling large inventories because they determine how 
quickly and effectively data can be stored,accessed and manipulated.
As we are dealing with large amount of data ,thus it makes it easy for us by using appropriate data 
structures we can improve the performance of operations like adding ,updating and deleting products.



Q.2 Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.

ANS:

ArrayList: Suitable for storing elements in a sequential manner. Provides fast access by index but is less efficient for search, insertion, and deletion operations.
HashMap: Offers average constant-time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations. Ideal for scenarios where quick access to data based on unique keys (e.g., productId) is required.
TreeMap: Provides sorted key-value pairs with logarithmic time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations. Useful when order matters.
LinkedList: Efficient for insertion and deletion operations but slower for access and search operations due to sequential traversal.
