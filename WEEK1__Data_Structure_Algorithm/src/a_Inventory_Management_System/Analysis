Q.1 Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.

O(1) on average because adding an element to the end of an ArrayList is an constant time operation.
 O(n) in the worst case because we might need to iterate through the entire list to find the product by its productId.
O(n) in the worst case because we might need to iterate through the entire list to find and remove the product by its productId.

Q.2 Discuss how you can optimize these operations.

Instead of using an ArrayList, consider using a different data structure like a HashMap if frequent searches, updates, and deletions are required, 
as it offers average constant-time complexity for these operations.
