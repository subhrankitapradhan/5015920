
Q.1 Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.

Time Complexity
Linear Search: O(n)
Binary Search: O(log n)

Q.2 Discuss when to use each algorithm based on the data set size and order.

Linear Search: Use for small or unsorted datasets where sorting is not feasible or necessary.
It's straightforward and does not require any preprocessing.
Binary Search:
Use for large, sorted datasets. It is significantly faster than linear search for large datasets but requires the list to be sorted,
which may involve an initial sorting cost (O(n log n)).
